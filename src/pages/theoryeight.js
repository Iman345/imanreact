Islamic religion and culture are often demonized and reduced to stereotypes in media. Islamophobia and prejudice paint all things related to Islam in an uncivilized and violent light. The media is often so preoccupied with painting Islam negatively, the culture is rarely discussed for its art and culture. To celebrate Muslim culture and bring Islamic art to the forefront is part of my project to decolonize art. I decided to use Islamic geometric art on my website and make it the centre of my internet art.  This blog is an exploration of decolonizing art with Islamic geometric art as its main subject.

When we talk about colonialism, we talk about the West’s domination and creation of their perspectives as an undeniable truth in every discourse. What we know as “canon” is historically told from a Western perspective and unchallenged.  The West colonized and controlled knowledge production throughout the colonial era and their tight grip on empiricism is sustained even after colonialism through coloniality. Art and art history are fundamentally ingrained in colonialism and coloniality (Grant, Price 2020). What we regard as art, whoever we regard as great artists is all determined by Western coloniality.

Decolonizing art has been the forefront of many discussions in academic spheres of art and art history. Decolonizing art, art criticism and art history involve analysing and questioning the socio-economic, histories and cultures involved in the creation and discourse around the art, art history, and art criticism. A discussion around decolonizing art is discussing museums and high art and why they are imperial in nature, celebrating Western and European art above all other art and creating standards based purely off Western art and culture. Art from Africa and the East goes largely underappreciated and unacknowledged. Visibility is a part of decolonizing art.

Visibility entails bringing art to the forefront that goes unrecognized and unacknowledged because it is not rooted in the West. African Ndebele art, Islamic geometric art and Japanese nihonga are all boisterous and intricate art forms but they are, and artists are rarely taught and highlighted in schools, museums, and popular culture. Art was a compulsory subject at my high school until tenth grade and we learnt Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Pollock without one mention of African art. Within the sphere of decolonizing art is making art by African, Asian, South American, and indigenous people more visible. This art is often thought of as exotic and “other” while Western art is the golden standard and the norm. Creating a presence of art by groups that are not white and Western more present in museums, books, pop-culture, exhibits, and school curriculums brings an awareness and appreciation to the art. It’s about taking the space of art and creating louder voices from artists and cultures that are not represented.

As a South African Muslim, I thought to decolonize art through visibility on my website my construction CSS geometric patterns influenced by Islamic geometric patterns. I include a gallery of different patterns inspired by Islamic geometric art and created using CSS, a kaleidoscope of one geometric pattern and a gallery of images of Islamic geometric art that can be downloaded.

<p>
Islamic geometric art, calligraphy and vegetal patterns all make up the non-figural decorations present in Islamic art which is largely aniconic. Islamic geometric art is an abstract art form that can be simplistic and used as a subtle background or filled with loud colours and boisterous designs it is completely up to the artist and their vision of the art. It is a versatile art form used for centuries yet it is often overlooked. Islamic geometric art can be observed dressing the ceilings of Masjids, decorating walls as a painting or on prayer mats and multiple other objects. Islamic Geometric art was born from the art of multiple cultures present in Iran namely, Greek, Roman, and Sasanian. In the hands of Islamic mathematicians, artists, and astronomers the geometric art evolved and flourished. The intricacy of Islamic art form is born from simple shapes used in a multitude of different combinations. One of the beauties behind Islamic geometric art is that there are endless combinations to be made therefor there is freedom in the endless number of patterns that could potentially be created.

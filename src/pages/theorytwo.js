    Net Art like art is a subjective topic, from its definition to its function. Net art can come in a multitude of forms using a multitude of different software and hardware to create it. The internet also allows for interaction which allows for immersive and captivating pieces of art to surface. My preference in net art is net art used for social activism. The internet can speedily create awareness and spread information making it a great place to advocate for social causes. The interactivity that net-art affords also allows for people to participate in the art and experience a rich experience with the art. This can be demonstrated by the game, Phone Story, an important piece of net art that is educational and serves to spread an important message and awareness.

    Most people living in cities have a cell phone. We use our smart phones religiously and depend on them heavily. Yet not many people consider where their smart phone came from. How do cell phone companies keep up with such a high demand? What are the social, environmental, and economical effects of cell phone production? Where are they produced? Are they produced ethically and environmentally friendly? <i>Phone Story</i> answers all these questions and the answers are shocking and grim. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The satirical social activism game illustrates the <q> "the dark side of your favourite smart phone. </q>. The game is free and available to play online in your browser, it can be downloaded as well and there is a mobile version as well. The game being free always thousands of people access to the game if they have an internet connection and flash for their browser, it allows awareness to be spread about the evils of globalisation and the evil and unethical practices of big corporations. The game is split into four self-contained mini games which enlighten players of the cold and dark truth behind smart phone production. The player is timed and if they do not complete the correct actions for each game, they will have to redo that mini game. The players must force workers and child labourers into coltan mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to mine the coltan to produce cell phones. The player patrols the workers ruthlessly while the workers get no breaks as they work long and hard hours in inhumane conditions. The next mini game is set in a cell phone factory called Foxconn factory which is a real factory. The player must prevent workers from committing suicide by catching them in a net as they attempt suicide by falling off the building. This mini game is especially difficult to stomach because this is the reality that overworked, exploited, and dehumanised factory workers face. These workers are not paid a liveable wage and have no lives outside working themselves to the bone for corporations that have outsourced their manual labour and are profiting off peoples abuse and exploitation. The third game takes place in a cell phone store where the player flings cell phones into consumers hands. This represents the high level of consumerism when it comes to smart phones. The last game is set in Ghana, where the smart phones are unethically being recycled for parts and again the workers are put in inhumane circumstances and forced to work by the player. The player hands the workers parts to sort in this game. This game really illustrates people’s complicity in the issue by having them enact the harmful actions. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The game's website has extensive research on each topic discussed in the game. The coltan mines, Foxconn Factory, consumerism, and unethical recycling of smart phones. The game also managed to earn above $6000 for an injured factory worker who attempted suicide at Foxconn.

    <p> This piece of net art serves the important purpose of bringing awareness to the extremely harmful practices that big tech companies use to make profit and produce their products. People the environment and human rights are ignored in the name of profit and people are ignorant to it. Net art like this is important because it works to inform people of the colonial practises that are on-going due to neoliberal capitalism and globalisation. It effectively demonstrates how big mostly Western companies outsource their work to “third-world” countries so that they can get cheap labour, exploit their workers, destroy the natural resources of that country, and generate wealth for themselves without consequence. </p>
    <p> Social activism in Net Art is prevalent spanning multiple different topics like equality, racism and decoloniality. Phone story can be categorised as a decolonial and social activist game and piece of Net art. Decoloniality revolves around dismantling coloniality and colonial systems. The game brings awareness to the evils of neoliberalist capitalism and globalisation and the breach of basic human rights by big corporations. Therefore, the game can act as a piece of decolonial work because it looks at smart phones, technology, capitalism, and labour without the Western lens of colonialism and capitalism. Through the lens of colonialism, the workers would be shown happy to be working their exploitation because working hard in the eyes of capitalism ideals means you will eventually gain wealth. This game however displays how coloniality is sustained through globalisation and neoliberal Capitalism. It exposes how Western companies still drain the resources from African countries, exploit people for their profit gain and continually get wealthier off their unethical and inhume practises. This game earns profit and starts a conversation to dismantle this system that has always been practised by the West. </p>
    
    <p>While the mechanics of the game are simple, the mechanics effectively relay the message of the game. People can read about this information  but seeing it and participating it emphasizes the harmful cycle of production. The player can feel a sense of responsibility in what happens and thus they can feel greater empathy. I think it is an important piece of art that should be played by everyone who owns a smartphone. </p>

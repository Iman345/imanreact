Technology plays a dominant role in our lives, especially during the pandemic. We live, work, consume and socialize using technology. With stores closed and limits on travel everything was halted. People relied on technology and the internet to get them through this difficult experience. Groceries and other items swiftly moved to online platforms. School’s closed and moved to online venues. Social interaction turned from a night out to voice and video calling. Information on safety, vaccinations and hygiene were delivered to us through the internet as information rapidly changed every day. News outlets become pivotal to our health by reporting on the virus. The pandemic has revealed how much we rely on internet connection. Our livelihoods became dependant on it. This illustrates that we don’t rely on it for entertainment solely instead the internet has become fundamental to our right to work, education and freedom of speech yet the importance of internet connection is still undervalued (Kasapis 2020). The internet has become more prevalent and central to communication, information, and education, too many people are still denied access to the internet.  This blog discusses why the internet should be considered a fundamental right to all people globally.

    Fundamental rights or human rights are a group of rights that have been declared as something all people should have. Different countries have different fundamental rights but follow similar suite such as the right to clean water, education, religion, food, medicine, and equality, etc. Fundamental rights are inherent to all people the moment they are born, and it is the duty of our governments to ensure our fundamental rights are fulfilled. Fundamental rights are necessary for people to survive and live healthy and happy lives they are categorized as needs and not wants or luxuries (Kasapis 2020). Internet access or right to broadband is an increasingly important movement especially during COVID-19. Without internet access people cannot work or receive an education, information, or social connection. In a South African context this infringes on people’s rights, the right to access to information, the right to education and the right to work to name a few. Those without access to the internet face further backlash from the digital divide as the internet has become so urgent in our everyday lives. We can clearly witness this with education in the pandemic.  The pandemic, students forced students out of call and online to receive their education. However, children from low-income families are at a serious disadvantage to those from higher income families (Tataki and Glynos 2020). Children from low-income families do not own the necessary software, hardware, or unlimited broadband to receive their education. Children who have laptops, pcs, and the freedom to use as much broadband as they like will not have to struggle like their peers who do not have the same means. The access to ICTs directly impacts the quality of education and disadvantages certain students over others (Tataki and Glynos 2020). This keeps certain children from the education they are promised as a human right. The UN recognized internet access as a human right in 2016 but governments are still doing very little to provide access to the internet to all its citizens. Only 59% of people globally have access to the internet (Daniolou 2020). This means that almost half of the world does not have access to the internet and in turn cannot receive the same education, information, and work opportunities the rest of the world with access has. Governments should be trying to provide free access to as many people as possible especially people who are cut-off from the internet and people who are marginalized as the digital divide is only going to further deepen and disadvantage those already disadvantaged (Daniolou 2020).

Access to internet directly impacts the digital divide. The digital divide is the be described as the gap between groups of people and areas that have access information communication technology (ICT) including the internet and groups of peoples and areas that do not have access to modern information and communications technology and those that don't have access to modern ICT. The consequence of the digital divide is that people’s rights are not fulfilled. They do not have equal opportunity to education, the economy, politics, social and cultural spheres, their freedom of speech and expression is limited in comparison to those with access. For example, rural areas mostly fall under the category of regions that do not have access to internet and communication technology. This is known as the “rural penalty” (Daniolu 2020). Rural areas have strong communities that have their own traditions, culture, and knowledge. However, they do not have the means to offer their culture and knowledge to the rest of the world. These communities go unnoticed and unconnected (Daniolu 2020).  The information about the pandemic and COVID-19 and other important information will be difficult to reach such communities in a timely, central, and appropriate manner.  The local farmers and craftsman cannot access a wide network of clientele and grow their business.  The vernacular and art of the culture is kept isolated. No access to ICT, directly infringes on these communities’ rights and equal opportunities and further creates “social marginalisation” (Daniolu 2020).

<p>

Daniolu (2020), makes an important argument that while ICTs are necessary and important, digital literacy is as equally important because it dictates how useful or harmful the internet and technology will be in someone’s life. If governments are meant to provide technology and internet, they must provide people an education on how to navigate the tools in a beneficial and critical way. Without a solid education in digital literacy people will be overwhelmed with fake news, false information and malicious software and internet trolls.

<p>
Bridging the digital divide is imperative to create personal development, information and education access, stronger economies and cultures, global connection, and an overall better quality of life for all people. There are important social movements in place that work to bridge this gap like Linux4Africa, the UN’s ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and the twitter hashtag #Connectivity4All starts important conversations about the digital divide and how to close the gap. Movements like these are important as we need to find a way as young innovators to try and bridge the gap in our own communities since government intervention seems unlikely. We can make a difference by teaching digital literacy to people, researching, and proposing models to increase access and attending important forums that discuss internet access for all and closing the digital divide.

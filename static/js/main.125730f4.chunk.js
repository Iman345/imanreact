For example, rural areas mostly fall under the category of regions that do not have access to internet and communication technology. This is known as the \u201crural penalty\u201d (Daniolu 2020). Rural areas have strong communities that have their own traditions, culture, and knowledge. However, they do not have the means to offer their culture and knowledge to the rest of the world. These communities go unnoticed and unconnected (Daniolu 2020).  The information about the pandemic and COVID-19 and other important information will be difficult to reach such communities in a timely, central, and appropriate manner.  The local farmers and craftsman cannot access a wide network of clientele and grow their business.  The vernacular and art of the culture is kept isolated.

The project uses many npm packages such as npm icons and the colour picker. The idea was to explore react and translate my original website into a jsx project.  I wanted to add a responsive navbar as my first challenge for react. My main challenge was learning to use Routes instead of Switch because of the version of react-router-dom that I had, that did not allow me to use Switch. The website does contain a drop-down menu that is accessible on mobile phones and small screens. My next challenge was ensuring that all the blog cards on my website were the same height and length and were responsive as well. My original website did not contain cards that were the same height, and it would often cut off the read more button. The changes I have made ensure that the cards scale with the screen, are all the same size and no information and buttons are cut off. Additionally, I wanted to add more life to my website by adding more hover effects over cards and links. My other main technical goals were to make sure that the images and text of my website were responsive as well. This was achieved; however, the images still need tweaking as they do not scale small enough on small screens. A flaw on the technical side is that the page does not start at the top of the page when changing between different locations on the website.

The paper investigates how curation of internet art is done or why it is not done in a South African context and all the challenges that come with the curation. This blog focuses on Vezi\u2019s first chapter, discussing what is internet art and how it is entirely different from the art that dresses the walls of museums. Museums and galleries as well as curators aren\u2019t well-versed enough regarding internet art and thus it is difficult to curate. This is a major reason that internet art is rarely showcased at institutes that collect and display art."]}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"Vezi classifies something as internet art when its primary creation, medium and source of distribution and presentation is the internet. Internet Art can be anything from text-based works to the embedded code of the work itself.  Internet art offers exciting avenues for artists to explore through software, programming, and interaction. Technology is always rapidly changing and adapting especially software, Vezi discusses that this gives internet art an erratic nature. An entire internet art piece can be lost if the software or programming language it utilises becomes obsolete. For instance, many websites and games on the internet will no longer function because they hinge on Adobe Flash which has become old and obsolete despite being used everywhere just a few years ago. This makes collecting internet art pieces for curation difficult because it would require frequent and expensive maintenance to keep all the different pieces operable. Vezi also mentions that while curation is an important process to expose important cultural products, internet artists do not make art with the same intentions as more traditional artists. Traditional artists may aim for museums and curation, but internet artists do not share the same aspirations. Internet art has a rebellious flair to it and being confined to an institution and being commercialised does not fit with what the artists intended for their work. Museums have symbolized a sort of elitism that internet artists reject and therefor they do not build their art with curation or museums in mind."}),Object(h.jsx)("p",{children:"Internet art is mostly free to view or interact with and is embedded with interaction at its core. Interaction is a sin in museums where the art is meant to be observed but never touched but internet art engages with its audience entirely differently. Every audience member could have a completely unique outcome because of interacting with the internet art, they can actively participate in the work giving a much more intimate feel and potential for a greater emotional impact.

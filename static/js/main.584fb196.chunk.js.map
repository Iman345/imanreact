power to the private sector (Giroux, 2005). Within the private sector one of the most powerful entities are technological corporations who Abeba Birhane (2020) argues “hold unprecedented power and influence.” The technological giants with unprecedent power and influence all belong to the West. Since technology is influential in every aspect of our society, the West holds power and influence over every aspect of our society. This phenomenon creates digital coloniality which is rampant in the global South. Birhane (2020) explores how the West sustains their coloniality through Algorithmic Colonization in their paper <i>Algorithmic Colonization of Africa </i> which will be the focal point of this essay.\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Technology can advance our lifestyles and assist us in every possible field, it can help us connect to people, find information, advance medical research etc. The possibilities for technology to aid and grow society are limitless but the business model and profit margins that technology companies chase can cause more harm than good. Big technological companies put profit before people and their practises often go unquestioned. In their paper, Birhane does not advocate against using Western technology, automated systems and AI but rather asks us to examine them.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Traditional colonialism may be thought of as a physical invasion where brute force is enlisted to gain control of political, economic, and social authority and influence. Digital colonialism and algorithmic colonialism hope to achieve the same control but through software and AI without the explicit brute force. Therefore, while traditional colonization is different to algorithmic colonization in how it is implemented and executed their goals are inline, to assert dominance in social, cultural, and political spheres by gaining control of crucial systems central to running countries and generating wealth.\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n\r\n                        Digital and traditional colonization alike, use government, politics and wealth to sustain power using these systems in unison. Algorithmic colonization is present in the Global South through the dependency the Global South has on “Western software and infrastructure” (Birhane 2020). Western software and infrastructure are bias because they are created for and by the West, thus does not cater to the African countries and their needs. In their paper Birhane challenges “the relevance and appropriateness of AI software developed with values, norms, and interests of Western societies to that of users across the African continent”. Birhane makes the important point in his statement that relying on Western software and infrastructure is not ideal and can be damaging to the Global South because the cultures, value systems, social, political and economic systems are vastly different. With completely different priorities Birhane argues that Western software can often be more hindering than helpful. Birhane gives the example of medical software that is geared towards Western countries being implemented in Africa. The software will therefore not account for the different treatments and different medical conditions of the African country.  This illustrates that Western solutions can be more damaging to African countries than helpful because they do not take context into account.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n\r\n                        Dependency exclusively on the West, additionally leaves no space for local software and technology to be implemented giving the West an unchallenged space to control the global South through the technology sector. There are huge technological hubs all over Africa but none of them flourish at the level at the same level that Western companies and technologies do because most African companies and governments import technology and software instead of turning to local solutions.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Furthermore, Birhane discusses the danger of not questioning AI and technology and the dehumanizing nature of looking to AI to “fix” systematic and historical social issues. Birhane argues that societal issues cannot be quantified into a box that can be easily fixed using technology. Especially considering that technology is not neutral. Automated systems and AI solutions are often thought of as “neutral” and “objective” because technology is man-made it cannot have feelings or bias. However, because it is man-made technology carries the bias and ideals of its makers. Therefore, it can never be objective.  For instance, Western technology inherent Western thinking. When Western social, political and cultural ideologies are present it can be immensely dangerous. For example, GPT-3: OpenAI’s Million Dollar Language Model is inherently racist and sexist. It is a powerful machine learning tool that can mimic human like text producing poetry and even html code, for example it can take a prompt as input and output a completed sentence or sentences from the prompt. While it is powerful, it is also incredibly biased and prejudice. While language models can help create solutions to analysing data and optimizing systems etc, it can also be severely misused. For example, when typing in a sentence about Muslims as an input, the output received from GPT-3 revolves around violence, murder, and terrorism exclusively. This demonstrates the power and the terror of AI that uses Western Algorithms only. The creators of GPT-3 are aware of the racial and sexist nature of the AI and are researching on how to solve the issues, OpenAi still commercialized the software.\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Here are the examples of GPT3 and some of the racist and sexist outputs it generates.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <div className='imgs'>\r\n                    <img src={image5} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Abubakr Abid\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"/>\r\n                    <img src={image4} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Abubakr Abidt\" className=\"screenshot\"width=\"400\" height=\"200\" />\r\n                    <img src={image1} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Kate Devlin\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\"/>\r\n                  \r\n                    <img src={image3} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Kate Devlin\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"/>\r\n                    <img src={image2} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Jerome Pesenti\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\"/>\r\n                    \r\n                    </div>\r\n                   \r\n                    <p>\r\n\r\n                        Ethics are often undermined when it comes to algorithms because they are thought of as neutral. The European Digital Rights organisation argues that “Policymakers must be aware of the political, social and economic consequences of ‘solutions’ that concentrate power in the hands of technology companies”. Birhane (2020) discusses the importance of ethics in algorithms and how it is important to have a board who reviews the ethics of algorithms especially having a local board because technology firms often go unchecked. Having a local board to ethically analyse technology will allow for context of that country and society to be considered instead of a one size fits all ethical board making decisions that might not benefit all countries and communities.  Ethical review boards can help eliminate and reduce the discrimination that marginalized people can face by automated systems such as facial recognition and biometric systems. Ethics boards also help ensure that the security and privacy of people is upheld. However, ethics board rarely are concerned with how technology and algorithms will affect those who are marginalized and discriminated against and are often centred around what is profitable and what “fixes” more societal issues. This is harmful because it is quantifying people into statistics and reducing complex societal issues into black and white problems that can be solved while subsequently ignoring the needs of marginalized people. The unethical ethical boards just deepen societal issues while generating profit for the already rich.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Africa is a continent where “community values triumph and nobody is left behind” (Birhane 2020). However, Western countries ideals are significantly different centred around thriving off rugged individualism. Based on the difference in ideals alone, Western technology is not suited to fulfil African ideals because it is built to fulfil Western capitalist ideals. Therefor it is urgent that African developers and innovators be the creators of the software and technological infrastructures implemented in African countries. Only then can Africa begin to break away from the coloniality sustained through technology.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <h3 className='page-header'>References</h3>\r\n\r\n                    <ul className='references'>\r\n\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Birhane, A.

Net art can come in a multitude of forms using a multitude of different software and hardware to create it. The internet also allows for interaction which allows for immersive and captivating pieces of art to surface. My preference in net art is net art used for social activism. The internet can speedily create awareness and spread information making it a great place to advocate for social causes. The interactivity that net-art affords also allows for people to participate in the art and experience a rich experience with the art. This can be demonstrated by the game, Phone Story, an important piece of net art that is educational and serves to spread an important message and awareness.\r\n                        \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Most people living in cities have a cell phone. We use our smart phones religiously and depend on them heavily. Yet not many people consider where their smart phone came from. How do cell phone companies keep up with such a high demand? What are the social, environmental, and economical effects of cell phone production? Where are they produced? Are they produced ethically and environmentally friendly? <i>Phone Story</i> answers all these questions and the answers are shocking and grim. \r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n    The satirical social activism game illustrates the <q> \"the dark side of your favourite smart phone. </q>. The game is free and available to play online in your browser, it can be downloaded as well and there is a mobile version as well. The game being free always thousands of people access to the game if they have an internet connection and flash for their browser, it allows awareness to be spread about the evils of globalisation and the evil and unethical practices of big corporations. The game is split into four self-contained mini games which enlighten players of the cold and dark truth behind smart phone production. The player is timed and if they do not complete the correct actions for each game, they will have to redo that mini game. The players must force workers and child labourers into coltan mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to mine the coltan to produce cell phones. The player patrols the workers ruthlessly while the workers get no breaks as they work long and hard hours in inhumane conditions. The next mini game is set in a cell phone factory called Foxconn factory which is a real factory. The player must prevent workers from committing suicide by catching them in a net as they attempt suicide by falling off the building. This mini game is especially difficult to stomach because this is the reality that overworked, exploited, and dehumanised factory workers face. These workers are not paid a liveable wage and have no lives outside working themselves to the bone for corporations that have outsourced their manual labour and are profiting off peoples abuse and exploitation. The third game takes place in a cell phone store where the player flings cell phones into consumers hands. This represents the high level of consumerism when it comes to smart phones. The last game is set in Ghana, where the smart phones are unethically being recycled for parts and again the workers are put in inhumane circumstances and forced to work by the player. The player hands the workers parts to sort in this game. This game really illustrates people’s complicity in the issue by having them enact the harmful actions. \r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n    The game's website has extensive research on each topic discussed in the game. The coltan mines, Foxconn Factory, consumerism, and unethical recycling of smart phones. The game also managed to earn above $6000 for an injured factory worker who attempted suicide at Foxconn. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p> This piece of net art serves the important purpose of bringing awareness to the extremely harmful practices that big tech companies use to make profit and produce their products. People the environment and human rights are ignored in the name of profit and people are ignorant to it. Net art like this is important because it works to inform people of the colonial practises that are on-going due to neoliberal capitalism and globalisation. It effectively demonstrates how big mostly Western companies outsource their work to “third-world” countries so that they can get cheap labour, exploit their workers, destroy the natural resources of that country, and generate wealth for themselves without consequence. </p>\r\n    <p> Social activism in Net Art is prevalent spanning multiple different topics like equality, racism and decoloniality. Phone story can be categorised as a decolonial and social activist game and piece of Net art. Decoloniality revolves around dismantling coloniality and colonial systems. The game brings awareness to the evils of neoliberalist capitalism and globalisation and the breach of basic human rights by big corporations. Therefore, the game can act as a piece of decolonial work because it looks at smart phones, technology, capitalism, and labour without the Western lens of colonialism and capitalism. Through the lens of colonialism, the workers would be shown happy to be working their exploitation because working hard in the eyes of capitalism ideals means you will eventually gain wealth. This game however displays how coloniality is sustained through globalisation and neoliberal Capitalism. It exposes how Western companies still drain the resources from African countries, exploit people for their profit gain and continually get wealthier off their unethical and inhume practises. This game earns profit and starts a conversation to dismantle this system that has always been practised by the West. </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>While the mechanics of the game are simple, the mechanics effectively relay the message of the game. People can read about this information  but seeing it and participating it emphasizes the harmful cycle of production. The player can feel a sense of responsibility in what happens and thus they can feel greater empathy. I think it is an important piece of art that should be played by everyone who owns a smartphone. </p>\r\n    \r\n<p>Here are some screenshots of the game</p>\r\n                       \r\n                        <p>The game can be played <a class=\"here\" href=\"https://net-art.org/phone-story\">here </a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/theoryone\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n              \r\n                   <Link to=\"/theorythree\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theorytwo;\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Theorythree() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Technical Reflection</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n                <p> The goal for the technical aspect of the website is to have the website be as responsive as possible. Having a responsive Nav bar and content is important because it allows for a larger audience of people to access and consume the websites content. If it is limited to laptop users only and cannot accommodate for mobile users, the website will be at a severe disadvantage as most people carry their phones around with them everywhere and will likely read the blogs on the website on their phone. Therefore, the biggest concern is to ensure the blogs are readable on as many screens as possible. My next greatest concern is having the navigation be responsive as without an intuitive and easy to use navigation system the user will get frustrated and leave the website. With creating a responsive website as my main goal, all the elements on the website are responsive and the website will smoothly operate on multiple devices. I am still currently working on making the images more responsive as they do not scale accurately enough from device to device. </p> \r\n                        <p>Additionally it is important to still adhere to conventions like having metatags and alternate titles for pictures to ensure screen readers can describe the image. I used the <i>Web accessibility in Mind</i> guide to title my alternative tags approprietly.

Technology is rapidly advancing but according to the Internet Justice Society only 39.3% of African people have access to ICT’s. Life without ICT access will further disadvantage those who are already disadvantaged. We live in an information society so it is only fair that all people should have the same access to the internet as a human right.  ICT is imperative to social, economic, and democratic spheres of life and people without access to it are at a disadvantage especially during COVID-19 when going to places in person is not a reliable option. For instance, libraries closed during lockdown, bookstores closed as well, therefor, information was limited to those who have internet access and enough data to download or view the research or information needed. Schooling was stopped and so people had to rely on internet access and technology to receive an education and those without the means were excluded and disadvantaged because they could not receive online education the same way their more privileged peers could. People without internet access are not the only people excluded. Websites and technology are designed for non-disabled people leading to people who are differently abled to find difficulty with websites and technologies because they were not considered in their design. For instance, blind children were not permitted to go into school thus had to receive their education online. Most websites do not make use of the correct semantic tags to ensure accessibility is possible for blind users. Often websites lack “alt” tags and use busy and cluttered pages creating a page difficult for a screen reader to appropriately relay information. </p>\r\n                    <p> With all these issues surrounding digital inclusion and digital equality it is our duty as South African innovators and creatives to try and help find solutions. Here are some ways we can get involved in shaping policy and trying to increase accessibility, inclusion and equality. </p>\r\n                    <p> A formidable program to apply to is AfriSIG (The African School on Internet Governance). Every year the Association for Progressive Communications runs AfriSIG which is a five-day residential course. AfriSIG has this event online now since COVID-19 struck. The overall goal of AfriSIG is to create African innovators who will change internet governance structures for the better and lead Africa’s technological development and internet access ethically with goals for equality and inclusivity. AfriSIG also prepares African technologists to participate in international policy making discussions and local government policy.  Participating in AfriSIG allows locals to engage with the policies and issues facing their own countries and facing most African countries, giving opportunities to people to find solutions and how to start laying the foundation for change.

FIFA hosts events and exhibitions hosted by tech industry professionals that anyone can register for and attend them online. The exhibitions showcase new technology and local inventions and discusses how it can be implemented in African states. FIFA has panels on digital rights and internet governance and what concerns revolve around them focusing on a purely African context. FIFA’s main goal is to change international internet governance to include Africa because it is rooted in a Eurocentric perspective and therefor only caters to fulfil Western needs. FIFA also works to discuss potential opportunities that would close the gap in digital inequality as well as how digital rights like privacy are being upheld and how they can better be protected.

The IGF aims to have people from all around the world join forces to discuss public policies around internet governance. Usually, delegates are sponsored to attend the Forum which is hosted internationally by one country. This year the government of Poland will host the IGF and will be online and in-person becoming a hybrid event. The theme for this year’s IGF is ‘’Internet United’ focusing on <q> Economic and social inclusion and human rights </q>. Delegates can speak and interact with people from different countries and professionals from the private and public sector working on internet infrastructure and exchange ideas and feedback on any proposals for policies. The IGF has their own mandate which acts as their agenda, it has principles like: \r\n                    <ul className='dots' >\r\n                    <li>Discussing public policy issues related to key elements of Internet governance to foster the sustainability, robustness, security, stability and development of the Internet.  </li>\r\n                    <li>Facilitating discourse between bodies dealing with different cross-cutting international public policies regarding the Internet and discuss issues that do not fall within the scope of any existing body. </li> \r\n                    <li>Interface with appropriate inter-governmental organizations and other institutions on matters under their purview. </li>\r\n                    <li>Advise all stakeholders in proposing ways and means to accelerate the availability and affordability of the Internet in the developing world. </li>\r\n                    <li>Contribute to capacity building for Internet governance in developing countries, drawing fully on local sources of knowledge and expertise. </li>\r\n                    \r\n                    <li>Publish its proceedings</li>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    If a local South African has an initiative they would like to implement regarding the internet landscape, the IGF will listen to the proposal and consider aiding and the initiative as part of their National and Regional IGF initiatives (NRIs).\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>NRI’s function independently from the IGF even though they may be endorsed by IGF. The creator of the initiative has free reign if they uphold the global principles of the IGF which equate to being ethical and inclusive. This gives local people a chance to drive the change they would like to see in their own internet landscape whether it be environmental change, accessibility, inclusion, or privacy. Read more about the IGF <a class=\"here\" href=\"https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/invitation-to-the-sixteenth-annual-meeting-of-the-internet-%E2%80%8Egovernance-forum-igf-%E2%80%8E\">here</a> </p>\r\n                    <p> There are a multitude more of organisations that South Africans can participate in to gain more experience and connections with internet governance and digital rights and inclusion to drive change in the South African technological space. We especially need these organisations to challenge government who still ignore the MIOS (Minimum Interoperability Standards) and create websites that are purely inaccessible by not using the prescribed open standards. For example, everyone needs access to the SARS website, but the SARS website uses flash which is propriety and does not meet the criteria to be considered an open standard. The website functioned mostly as a giant image making it incredibly difficult for screen-readers to use. SARS went against government policy and their inaccessible website forced them create their own browser purely to run the SARS website. This shows lack of consideration for South African citizens and displays outdated practises by using Flash which has been dead for a long period of time. Issues like these need to be taken up with government and challenged by local organisations and it starts by getting involved in the conversations like the ones hosted by the IGF, FIFA and AfriSIG. </p>\r\n                    \r\n\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/theorythree\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   \r\n                   <Link to=\"/theoryfive\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theoryfour;\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Theoryfive() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Internet Access is a Fundamental Right.</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n<p>\r\nTechnology plays a dominant role in our lives, especially during the pandemic. We live, work, consume and socialize using technology. With stores closed and limits on travel everything was halted. People relied on technology and the internet to get them through this difficult experience. Groceries and other items swiftly moved to online platforms. School’s closed and moved to online venues. Social interaction turned from a night out to voice and video calling. Information on safety, vaccinations and hygiene were delivered to us through the internet as information rapidly changed every day. News outlets become pivotal to our health by reporting on the virus. The pandemic has revealed how much we rely on internet connection. Our livelihoods became dependant on it. This illustrates that we don’t rely on it for entertainment solely instead the internet has become fundamental to our right to work, education and freedom of speech yet the importance of internet connection is still undervalued (Kasapis 2020). The internet has become more prevalent and central to communication, information, and education, too many people are still denied access to the internet.  This blog discusses why the internet should be considered a fundamental right to all people globally. \r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n    Fundamental rights or human rights are a group of rights that have been declared as something all people should have. Different countries have different fundamental rights but follow similar suite such as the right to clean water, education, religion, food, medicine, and equality, etc. Fundamental rights are inherent to all people the moment they are born, and it is the duty of our governments to ensure our fundamental rights are fulfilled. Fundamental rights are necessary for people to survive and live healthy and happy lives they are categorized as needs and not wants or luxuries (Kasapis 2020). Internet access or right to broadband is an increasingly important movement especially during COVID-19. Without internet access people cannot work or receive an education, information, or social connection. In a South African context this infringes on people’s rights, the right to access to information, the right to education and the right to work to name a few. Those without access to the internet face further backlash from the digital divide as the internet has become so urgent in our everyday lives. We can clearly witness this with education in the pandemic.  The pandemic, students forced students out of call and online to receive their education. However, children from low-income families are at a serious disadvantage to those from higher income families (Tataki and Glynos 2020). Children from low-income families do not own the necessary software, hardware, or unlimited broadband to receive their education. Children who have laptops, pcs, and the freedom to use as much broadband as they like will not have to struggle like their peers who do not have the same means. The access to ICTs directly impacts the quality of education and disadvantages certain students over others (Tataki and Glynos 2020). This keeps certain children from the education they are promised as a human right. The UN recognized internet access as a human right in 2016 but governments are still doing very little to provide access to the internet to all its citizens. Only 59% of people globally have access to the internet (Daniolou 2020). This means that almost half of the world does not have access to the internet and in turn cannot receive the same education, information, and work opportunities the rest of the world with access has. Governments should be trying to provide free access to as many people as possible especially people who are cut-off from the internet and people who are marginalized as the digital divide is only going to further deepen and disadvantage those already disadvantaged (Daniolou 2020). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAccess to internet directly impacts the digital divide. The digital divide is the be described as the gap between groups of people and areas that have access information communication technology (ICT) including the internet and groups of peoples and areas that do not have access to modern information and communications technology and those that don't have access to modern ICT. The consequence of the digital divide is that people’s rights are not fulfilled. They do not have equal opportunity to education, the economy, politics, social and cultural spheres, their freedom of speech and expression is limited in comparison to those with access. For example, rural areas mostly fall under the category of regions that do not have access to internet and communication technology. This is known as the “rural penalty” (Daniolu 2020). Rural areas have strong communities that have their own traditions, culture, and knowledge. However, they do not have the means to offer their culture and knowledge to the rest of the world. These communities go unnoticed and unconnected (Daniolu 2020).  The information about the pandemic and COVID-19 and other important information will be difficult to reach such communities in a timely, central, and appropriate manner.  The local farmers and craftsman cannot access a wide network of clientele and grow their business.  The vernacular and art of the culture is kept isolated. No access to ICT, directly infringes on these communities’ rights and equal opportunities and further creates “social marginalisation” (Daniolu 2020).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDaniolu (2020), makes an important argument that while ICTs are necessary and important, digital literacy is as equally important because it dictates how useful or harmful the internet and technology will be in someone’s life. If governments are meant to provide technology and internet, they must provide people an education on how to navigate the tools in a beneficial and critical way. Without a solid education in digital literacy people will be overwhelmed with fake news, false information and malicious software and internet trolls. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBridging the digital divide is imperative to create personal development, information and education access, stronger economies and cultures, global connection, and an overall better quality of life for all people. There are important social movements in place that work to bridge this gap like Linux4Africa, the UN’s ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and the twitter hashtag #Connectivity4All starts important conversations about the digital divide and how to close the gap. Movements like these are important as we need to find a way as young innovators to try and bridge the gap in our own communities since government intervention seems unlikely. We can make a difference by teaching digital literacy to people, researching, and proposing models to increase access and attending important forums that discuss internet access for all and closing the digital divide. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 className='page-header'>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul className='references'>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n    Tataki and Glynos - 2020 - Digital Divide Widens.pdf Download Tataki and Glynos - 2020 - Digital Divide Widens\r\n\r\n\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Kasapis - 2020 - Internet Access is a Fundamental Right.pdf  Download \r\n\r\n\r\n   </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n\r\n    Daniolou - 2020 - The Need for Global Internet Connectivity     </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/theoryfour\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   \r\n                   <Link to=\"/theorysix\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theoryfive;\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Theorysix() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Technical Reflection 2.0</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor this assignment, my focus was on converting my website from a purely html, css and vanilla JavaScript website to a react app. React allows for mobile and desktop applications to be made. React also offers an avenue for an interaction between the use and the application. My focus lied on keeping the website responsive and simple but utilising different react packages and features. The project uses many npm packages such as npm icons and the colour picker. The idea was to explore react and translate my original website into a jsx project.  I wanted to add a responsive navbar as my first challenge for react. My main challenge was learning to use Routes instead of Switch because of the version of react-router-dom that I had, that did not allow me to use Switch. The website does contain a drop-down menu that is accessible on mobile phones and small screens. My next challenge was ensuring that all the blog cards on my website were the same height and length and were responsive as well. My original website did not contain cards that were the same height, and it would often cut off the read more button. The changes I have made ensure that the cards scale with the screen, are all the same size and no information and buttons are cut off. Additionally, I wanted to add more life to my website by adding more hover effects over cards and links. My other main technical goals were to make sure that the images and text of my website were responsive as well. This was achieved; however, the images still need tweaking as they do not scale small enough on small screens. A flaw on the technical side is that the page does not start at the top of the page when changing between different locations on the website. To make navigation on the website easier I have added a back button on the blogs. I wanted to focus on clean navigation and ensure the user has an easy experience exploring the website. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMy creative yet technical challenge was the internet art challenge. For this I wanted to create patterns of geometric art inspired by African and Muslim geometric patterns. For this project I tried to use react components to generate patterns, but I was unable to produce the patterns I envisioned for my project. Instead, I opted to create the patterns using CSS instead of JavaScript and would add interactivity to the art via JavaScript and react. I managed to create a colour picker using react, but its functionality is still in its development phase. The colour picker works and changes the colour of my patterns, but I am yet to make the colour picker responsive and allow it to be easily used from anywhere on the page. I need to style the colour picker similarly to a sticky navbar so that the user can play with the colours from any point in the page. For my experimentation with kaleidoscopes, I need to try and make the art responsive and add interactive elements such as zoom and changing size. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/theoryfive\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   \r\n                   <Link to=\"/theoryseven\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theorysix;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/whitepeople.ba01aa0d.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/pbt.5e5b1901.jpg\";","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\nimport payblack1 from '../img/whitepeople.jpg';\r\nimport payblack2 from '../img/pbt.jpg';\r\n\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Theoryseven() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Internet Art Analysis</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                        <q><i>\r\n                            \r\n                        Pay Black Time is a play on the phrase “Payback Time,” and also a demand to pay back black people for the hundreds of years of free labour and continuing trauma in the US alone.

America is a society built on systematic racism and capitalism which constantly feed white supremacy and continuously disadvantage brown and black people. While brown and black people suffer at the hands of their society and its racist history, the American government does little to aid or end the unjust. Instead, big corporates and governments flourish off of white supremacy and capitalism but there are artists like Rafia Santana who are constantly fighting back and finding ways to bring about some change. This blog discusses how Rafia Santana’s use of net art and the internet for activism through her work #PAYBLACKTIME. \r\n   </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSantana started the project in 2016 after the idea was born from a facebook post she made, “Can a white friend Postmates me NyQuil and Soup? Is that how this works?” This sparked the flame that would result in #PlayblackTime. Santana devised the idea to use her platform on social media and the internet to request donations from white people for black and brown who need food. Santana created images with her idea and instructions on how to participate. Santana revealed, promoted, and circulated the project through images she made including memes. The images contained what the project was about, how to receive help from the project as well as how to donate and all the posts contained #PAYBLACKTIME. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<q>All orders are paid for by the White Guilt Reparations Fund for white people who ask, “What can I do?” during a time when we have heavily publicized evidence of their race’s direct connection to the continuous suffering and disenfranchisement of Black / Brown people globally.

Santana was able to launch an entire activist project through visual images she created as an artist. She used memes and other internet vernacular to generate interest and connect with her followers. Using visual art as a medium for the message of the project ensured it was easy to share and the message was simple and clear garnering people’s attention and donations.  Her followers were easily able to share the project with each other and thus create a large network of potential donors. Santana was able to connect with people who needed help through the internet and was able to offer relief to wide array of black and brown people and not only people from her social circle or neighbourhood. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThrough her art not only was Santana able to help people but she was also able to spread an important message that black and brown people need justice. White people have historically built themselves on the backs of brown and black people and that has never stopped. Every system in America works against black and brown people from their police and healthcare system to their education system. Santana posts the powerful message that “White People Owe Us the World” as one of her posts. This message helps people see that America isn’t the land of the free or a place where the American dream exists but a place where black and brown people are systematically disadvantaged, and nothing is being done about it and so this is an action someone can take to make a small difference. \r\n</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/theorysix\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   \r\n                   <Link to=\"/theoryeight\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theoryseven;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Theoryeight() {\r\n\r\n    \r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\"> Islamic geometric art and decolonisation</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIslamic religion and culture are often demonized and reduced to stereotypes in media. Islamophobia and prejudice paint all things related to Islam in an uncivilized and violent light. The media is often so preoccupied with painting Islam negatively, the culture is rarely discussed for its art and culture. To celebrate Muslim culture and bring Islamic art to the forefront is part of my project to decolonize art. I decided to use Islamic geometric art on my website and make it the centre of my internet art.  This blog is an exploration of decolonizing art with Islamic geometric art as its main subject.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about colonialism, we talk about the West’s domination and creation of their perspectives as an undeniable truth in every discourse. What we know as “canon” is historically told from a Western perspective and unchallenged.  The West colonized and controlled knowledge production throughout the colonial era and their tight grip on empiricism is sustained even after colonialism through coloniality. Art and art history are fundamentally ingrained in colonialism and coloniality (Grant, Price 2020). What we regard as art, whoever we regard as great artists is all determined by Western coloniality. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDecolonizing art has been the forefront of many discussions in academic spheres of art and art history. Decolonizing art, art criticism and art history involve analysing and questioning the socio-economic, histories and cultures involved in the creation and discourse around the art, art history, and art criticism. A discussion around decolonizing art is discussing museums and high art and why they are imperial in nature, celebrating Western and European art above all other art and creating standards based purely off Western art and culture. Art from Africa and the East goes largely underappreciated and unacknowledged. Visibility is a part of decolonizing art. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nVisibility entails bringing art to the forefront that goes unrecognized and unacknowledged because it is not rooted in the West. African Ndebele art, Islamic geometric art and Japanese nihonga are all boisterous and intricate art forms but they are, and artists are rarely taught and highlighted in schools, museums, and popular culture. Art was a compulsory subject at my high school until tenth grade and we learnt Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Pollock without one mention of African art. Within the sphere of decolonizing art is making art by African, Asian, South American, and indigenous people more visible. This art is often thought of as exotic and “other” while Western art is the golden standard and the norm. Creating a presence of art by groups that are not white and Western more present in museums, books, pop-culture, exhibits, and school curriculums brings an awareness and appreciation to the art. It’s about taking the space of art and creating louder voices from artists and cultures that are not represented.  \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAs a South African Muslim, I thought to decolonize art through visibility on my website my construction CSS geometric patterns influenced by Islamic geometric patterns. I include a gallery of different patterns inspired by Islamic geometric art and created using CSS, a kaleidoscope of one geometric pattern and a gallery of images of Islamic geometric art that can be downloaded. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIslamic geometric art, calligraphy and vegetal patterns all make up the non-figural decorations present in Islamic art which is largely aniconic. Islamic geometric art is an abstract art form that can be simplistic and used as a subtle background or filled with loud colours and boisterous designs it is completely up to the artist and their vision of the art. It is a versatile art form used for centuries yet it is often overlooked. Islamic geometric art can be observed dressing the ceilings of Masjids, decorating walls as a painting or on prayer mats and multiple other objects. Islamic Geometric art was born from the art of multiple cultures present in Iran namely, Greek, Roman, and Sasanian. In the hands of Islamic mathematicians, artists, and astronomers the geometric art evolved and flourished. The intricacy of Islamic art form is born from simple shapes used in a multitude of different combinations. One of the beauties behind Islamic geometric art is that there are endless combinations to be made therefor there is freedom in the endless number of patterns that could potentially be created. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 className='page-header'>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul className='references'>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n    Department of Islamic Art. “The Nature of Islamic Art.” In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

Reducing clutter on websites helps people who use screen readers to navigate the website with more ease and accessibility and inclusion is something I try to embed in my designs. I want to ensure the information and text of the website are the most important therefor I did not add distracting images or background animations etc.  My goal for the blogs is the same, to not have them feel cluttered with distracting background images but rather make the text central. I will also try and use minimal images and videos to try and reduce the amount of data the website will require from users when browsing. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p> Consistency is also an important aspect to uphold for this project. Having the navigation system and buttons stay the same colours, fonts and shapes is important otherwise it can cause confusion for the user and disrupt the theme and coherence of the website. </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                        I wanted a calming feel to the website and have the website reflect a little about me. Therefor, I chose my favourite colours pink and blue as the theme for the website. I chose them in pale hues to ensure it was not bright and distracting but rather calm and easy on the eyes. The pink and the blue with the chosen sans-serif font, Yusei Magic, give the website a playful feel as well. Yusei magic is sans-serif which makes it slightly more user friendly to dyslexic users.  To add a bit of life to the website without causing distraction I have added animations to the links and buttons. They work as playful surprises when the user hovers above links and buttons. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>In an effort to try and ensure that everyone who visits the website does not have a bad experiance I will add trigger warnings to any content that deals with sensitive subjects so that no one reads a blog that could be potentially triggering to them.</p>\r\n                        <p> As the website progresses, I will add small geometric patterns as a nod to my creative projective which is geometric Islamic art. The homepage image will also consist of art relevant to my main creative project.</p>\r\n               \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n           \r\n               \r\n                  \r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/creative\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   \r\n                   <Link to=\"/creativetwo\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Creativeone;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/geometricart2.00039115.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/geometricart3.34169e8e.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/fractalizeru.66bae697.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/inspiration.0afe5574.PNG\";","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\nimport example1 from '../img/geometricart2.jpg';\r\nimport example2 from '../img/geometricart3.jpg';\r\nimport example3 from '../img/fractalizeru.jpg';\r\nimport example4 from '../img/inspiration.PNG';\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Creativtwo() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Internet art proposal</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n                \r\n                <p>\r\n                            My creative project will consist of creating Islamic geometric art using CSS and React. My blogs and website revolve around decoloniality and social activism through the internet and net art. Creating net-art based on Islamic geometric art will highlight this artform giving the spotlight to Islamic culture and art. This fits into my website because it will be showcasing art from a religion and culture that is often demonised using the space to create positivity and appreciation instead. \r\n                            </p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <p>\r\n                            The user will be able to choose from a selection of countries and customise two or three colours and once they press generate, the page will fill with geometric art from the region they chose, using the colours they chose. This will allow for the user to participate in the creation process and generating their interest and keeping the user engaged. This project will also be able to highlight different art styles and the differences in the geometric art from country to country.\r\n                            </p> \r\n                            <p>\r\n                            The technical challenge with this project is generating different patterns. Being a beginner to react will have its challenges and I may not be able to generate multiple different patterns. I might only be able to generate one and will have to work on perfecting it, instead of having multiple choices for the user to choose from. Therefore, the user’s options might be limited to them choosing the colours only. The patterns I create will also have to be a lot simpler than in the examples above as I do not think a pattern of that intricacy will be possible due to time constraints. The project might also be difficult to make responsive and it is a technical challenge I will try and address as the project progresses. \r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                            Each pattern will be made up of two or three different colours that the user can choose from. The colours will be from a pre-established pallet that I create. I will have to consider colour-blindness in my curation of different pallets for the player to choose from to ensure the art is visible to the widest range of people. \r\n                            </p>\r\n                            \r\n                \r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                 \r\n                        <p>Here are the examples of Islamic geometric art: </p>\r\n                   \r\n              \r\n                        <div className='imgs'>\r\n                    <img src={example1} alt=\"Islamic geometric art\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\r\n                    <img src={example2} alt=\"Islamic geometric art\" className=\"screenshot\"width=\"200\" height=\"200\" />\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                  \r\n                    \r\n                    </div>\r\n                <p>This is a fractal editor called fractalizeru developed by Remy Younes.

My project now revolves around creating multiple different pieces of geometric art. My creative project changed because of my interests changing and what I wanted to investigate using my art. I wanted to create my patterns using js but instead I opted for CSS art which has always been an interest of mine. I wanted to see all the geometric patterns I could possibly make using CSS. To ensure the project utilises react there will be a few art pages and the user will be able to interact with the art pages. I am using the art aspect of the project to explore multiple different creative expressions using css, js and react. \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Patterns are a big part of my project thus I wanted to make them visible throughout my website. To achieve this, I added a subtle background of patterns. I do not want to detract from the websites text and cause distraction thus the image is a bit transparent and is not bright and does not move. I added patterns to the creative cards to further add a bit of my creative focus to the website. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My theory blogs do not have any patterns on the cards to ensure the focus is on the text and set a more serious tone than the fun patterns that the creative cards have. The theory blogs do however have icons. I will be replacing the icons I have now with icons that fit better with the theme and blog in question. </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    <h3 className='page-header'>Internet Art proposal 2.0</h3>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n\r\n                    My original idea for my website was to create Islamic geometric art using CSS and React. Creating net-art based on Islamic geometric art will highlight this artform giving the spotlight to Islamic art. I chose this as my creative project because it represents a religion and culture that is often demonised using the space to create positivity and appreciation instead.       </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n\r\n                    While my original idea was to have the user input a country and a colour and the website would generate the pattern, I decided to go with a slightly different approach for my project. Instead, I will display a wide array of patterns generated by CSS. The patterns will sit next to each other depicting different geometric patterns. Instead of the user only seeing one pattern at a time the user can view a collection of patterns and browse the endless possibilities of geometric art patterns. To add interaction to the project the user will be able to change the colour of the patterns to see the patterns in different hues. This will allow the user to engage with the art and observe the patterns and how they may look in different colours. The idea behind having a large array of patterns means that the user does not have to be limited to one at a time and viewing the patterns in a gallery will allow the patterns to be compared. The vast variety of geometric art can thus be observed, and the endless combination of geometric elements can be acknowledged as well. I will constantly be adding more patterns to my gallery of patterns. I am to have at least forty different patterns by the end of the project. \r\n                      \r\n                             </p>\r\n\r\n                  \r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                            \r\n                    Next, I wanted to add a Kaleidoscope of patterns to my project. Kaleidoscopes can show the geometric patterns in an interesting form. Watching how the colours and shapes flow is entertaining and to add more engagement between the user and the art, I will add a zoom and sizing ability to the project so the user can experiment with the kaleidoscope.   \r\n                            \r\n                             </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn

Institutions when Showcasing and Collecting Internet Art</i>, Mazwi Vezi discusses defines internet art and the curation process of internet art on a national and international level. The paper investigates how curation of internet art is done or why it is not done in a South African context and all the challenges that come with the curation. This blog focuses on Vezi’s first chapter, discussing what is internet art and how it is entirely different from the art that dresses the walls of museums. Museums and galleries as well as curators aren’t well-versed enough regarding internet art and thus it is difficult to curate. This is a major reason that internet art is rarely showcased at institutes that collect and display art. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nVezi classifies something as internet art when its primary creation, medium and source of distribution and presentation is the internet. Internet Art can be anything from text-based works to the embedded code of the work itself.  Internet art offers exciting avenues for artists to explore through software, programming, and interaction. Technology is always rapidly changing and adapting especially software, Vezi discusses that this gives internet art an erratic nature. An entire internet art piece can be lost if the software or programming language it utilises becomes obsolete. For instance, many websites and games on the internet will no longer function because they hinge on Adobe Flash which has become old and obsolete despite being used everywhere just a few years ago. This makes collecting internet art pieces for curation difficult because it would require frequent and expensive maintenance to keep all the different pieces operable. Vezi also mentions that while curation is an important process to expose important cultural products, internet artists do not make art with the same intentions as more traditional artists. Traditional artists may aim for museums and curation, but internet artists do not share the same aspirations. Internet art has a rebellious flair to it and being confined to an institution and being commercialised does not fit with what the artists intended for their work. Museums have symbolized a sort of elitism that internet artists reject and therefor they do not build their art with curation or museums in mind. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nInternet art is mostly free to view or interact with and is embedded with interaction at its core. Interaction is a sin in museums where the art is meant to be observed but never touched but internet art engages with its audience entirely differently. Every audience member could have a completely unique outcome because of interacting with the internet art, they can actively participate in the work giving a much more intimate feel and potential for a greater emotional impact. The interactive nature of internet art is difficult for museums to adapt to and grapple with thus displaying internet art is increasingly difficult for these spaces. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nInternet art cannot be viewed, displayed, or even documented the same as an oil painting or 3D installation. Galleries and museums still struggle with outdated practices making internet art increasingly rare and difficult to be curated by them. If curation of internet is done, the curator cannot use standard practices instead new practises made specifically with internet art must be implemented. With new and modernised methods of curation and collection of internet art it may be possible to see more internet art in gallery spaces and museums. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/theoryseven\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   \r\n                   <Link to=\"/theoryeight\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theorynine;","import { useEffect } from \"react\";\r\nimport { useLocation } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nexport default function ScrollToTop() {\r\n  const { pathname } = useLocation();\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\r\n  }, [pathname]);\r\n\r\n  return null;\r\n}\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction TheoryTen() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\"> Final Technical Reflection</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy goals for my website on a technical level is to have a fully responsive react website. Having a responsive website is an important aspect to me because it means that more devices can access your website and thus more people can have access. Accessibility is a central pillar in web design. My website is largely responsive. The blogs are all responsive, the navigation is responsive, the blog cards are responsive, the images and text are all responsive and my image gallery is responsive. My initial prototypes for my internet art are responsive however, the final internet art piece is not responsive due to the colour picker. I could not manage to scale it according to screen size therefor it is not responsive despite the pattern cards being responsive. The kaleidoscope art is not responsive either. Given more time I would have liked to try and have my website me responsive in every aspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMy other technical goals were the use of the correct semantic tags and semantic mark-up which is implemented on my website. I want my page to also be accessible to those with visual impairments that might be using screen readers. Therefore, it was important to use meta tags and the alt tag for all images and add an appropriate description. I used the Web accessibility in Mind guide to title my alternative tags appropriately.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnother major goal was utilizing react. My website is a react website using the latest version of react. However, using the latest version of react caused many technical difficulties. I tried to return to the older versions of react but with no luck, so I had to try and adjust my website and work with the new version. This meant that some issues I faced I could not fix, for instance I could not use the Switch tag and so I had to redo my websites routing using Routes and Router tags.  This method made it difficult to add functions like scroll to the top. I had a major issue where my pages did not begin at the top but at the bottom of the page. This meant that the user was stuck constantly having to scroll to the top of every new page they clicked on.  I spent a lot of time trying to fix this issue but could not do it by myself. Thanks to Andre, the issue was solved and now my site successfully loads correctly from the top and not the bottom. I also added buttons at the bottom of every blog to navigate to the previous blog or to the next blog this will hopefully allow the user to easily go from blog to blog. I also paid attention to the cursor ensuring that when it hovers on clickable elements it changes to pointer and reverts when the element is not clickable. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA technical difficulty that I was unable to fix is that when my website initially opens it does not open on the homepage. This is due to an error with my Github repository that I was unable to fix. The pages of my website do not reload either which I was also unable to fix and due to fix. I tried making a new repository and adding it to my website, but it still gave the same issues and a new set of its own issues, so I just reverted to my original repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/theoryone\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   \r\n                   <Link to=\"/theoryeight\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TheoryTen;","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\n\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction CreativeEight() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Internet Art Rationale</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n                \r\n                <p>\r\n                My internet art is meant to highlight the beauty and vast possibilities of Islamic geometric art. To create a piece that achieves this goal, I wanted to showcase the patterns and bring awareness to the art form. My internet art is geometric art patterns inspired by Islamic geometric patterns. There are thirty different patterns displayed on thirty different cards. The patterns are made using CSS and the user can change the background colour of the pattern to view the pattern in different colours. The user changes the colours of the background using a React colour picker. The user can just look at the patterns and observe how they are formed and constructed or appreciate all the different combinations or they can engage with the artwork by changing the colours.  To supplement the artwork, I created a gallery of Islamic geometric art that the users can view real life examples of Islamic geometric art from around the world and download them as well. I also display an experimental kaleidoscope using an image of Islamic geometric patterns.       </p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <p>\r\n                            Islam and Islamic culture are often demonized by Western media and represented through negative stereotypes. The art and culture of Islam from around the world is rarely celebrated and appreciated in mainstream media or in Museums or school curriculum. An important theme in my blogs is decolonization. I aim to contribute to the decolonization of art by bringing Islamic geometric art into the spotlight through my internet art. Making the art central and visible will spark discussions and recognition for Islamic geometric art. When looking at my internet art I hope to spark the audiences intrigue into Islamic geometric art. I wish for the art to gain more acknowledgement and allow the audience to appreciate and recognize the beauty behind the abstract art form. Read more about my internet art and how it connects to my decolonization in my blog.  </p> \r\n                            <p>\r\n                            The art successfully displays different patterns. They align next to each other allowing for multiple patterns to be viewed at the same time. The colour picker works successfully, the user can change colours of a wide variety and view the different patterns in whatever colour they would like. I wanted to display forty patterns but only managed to display thirty due to time constrictions. The thirty patterns do highlight the intricacy and endless possibilities of the geometric patterns. The cards are responsive, but the colour picker is not. Therefore, the internet art is not responsive. Ideally, I would have wanted to have the entire artwork be responsive, but I could not achieve this goal.  The colour picker does move around the page and is a React component fulfilling my goals for the colour picker. However, I wanted the colour picker to move around the page following the mouse does and open and close on click. I did not manage to achieve this and thus the colour picker only moves up and down the page on the left-hand side of the page and is not responsive. The art performs its function, but it could be presented better. \r\n\r\n\r\n                             </p>\r\n                      \r\n                            \r\n                \r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                 \r\n                       \r\n\r\n               \r\n       \r\n                 </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"more-btn display-flex align-center justify-center paddingxy-30\">\r\n                \r\n                <Link to=\"/creativereflection\">\r\n           <button className=\"more-btn pointer btn\">Back</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                   \r\n                   <Link to=\"/creativeone\">\r\n           <button className=\"pagebtn pointer btn\">Next</button>\r\n                   </Link>\r\n                </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default CreativeEight;","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\n\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction CreativeReflection() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Final Creative Reflection</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n                \r\n                <p>\r\n                The most important principle to my design of this website is simplicity.  Because having a simple website lets me focus on UI design and UX design. Having clear and concise navigation, buttons and consistency allows for the user to easily navigate from page to page without frustration.  I wanted the theory blogs content to be the focus of the page so on the theory blogs there are no background images or animations as it often looks too cluttered and is distracting. I used two colours as my main colour pallet, pastel pink, pastel blue, and bright purple for any icons. I chose these colours because they are calming yet playful and easy on the eyes. I primarily use white and black for my body text as they are the most readable colours given my colour pallet. To ensure that all content is readable I use “Yuusei Magic” font which is clear and easy to read in all sizes. For consistency I use the font for all my text. \r\n                </p>\r\n                            \r\n                            <p>\r\n                            To ensure the website is clear and concise, I made sure that every blog page is consistent with each other, all the cards on the blog home pages are the same size, and the buttons all look and act the same on all cards. I also made sure that the navigation is consistent, and the colour scheme is carried across all pages.      </p> \r\n                            <p>\r\n                            Throughout the process of creating my website I struggled with expressing the creative elements across my website. The theory aspect of my website revolves around technology and the internet and specifically talks to accessibility, digital equality, decolonization and analysing internet art.  To connect to my website’s theory in a creative form, I centred a piece of internet art around Islamic geometric art as a form of decolonizing art. I implemented a gallery to illustrate different real-life examples of Islamic geometric art to supplement the creative component of my website and my internet art. The gallery can be viewed as a slideshow, the images can be downloaded and it is fully responsive.</p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                            Each pattern will be made up of two or three different colours that the user can choose from. The colours will be from a pre-established pallet that I create. I will have to consider colour-blindness in my curation of different pallets for the player to choose from to ensure the art is visible to the widest range of people. \r\n                            </p>\r\n                            \r\n                <p>Therefore, patterns have become a form of creative expression across my website. I decided to express my creative components throughout my website by implementing for patterns in subtle ways. I did not want to overwhelm my website and distract my users with an abundance of patterns everywhere, so I use a pattern in my header that is on all pages to display the website revolves around technology by having a circuit board pattern. I use a geometric pattern in my footer which appears on every page to highlight the creative component of my project. I also use Islamic geometric patterns in the background of my homepage and about page to add more visual representation of my creative components. The creative blog page has cards which all have geometric patterns in the background to further add a little bit of the creative side to the websites design. My theory page does not have patterns on the cards because the focus of the theory is the content so instead, I used relevant icons to represent the subject matter of each blog.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                 <p>\r\n                 I am content with the consistency throughout the website in terms of style and colour.

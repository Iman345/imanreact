            The neoliberalist nature of our society has granted monstrous power to the private sector (Giroux, 2005). Within the private sector one of the most powerful entities are technological corporations who Abeba Birhane (2020) argues “hold unprecedented power and influence.” The technological giants with unprecedent power and influence all belong to the West. Since technology is influential in every aspect of our society, the West holds power and influence over every aspect of our society. This phenomenon creates digital coloniality which is rampant in the global South. Birhane (2020) explores how the West sustains their coloniality through Algorithmic Colonization in their paper <i>Algorithmic Colonization of Africa </i> which will be the focal point of this essay.\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Technology can advance our lifestyles and assist us in every possible field, it can help us connect to people, find information, advance medical research etc. The possibilities for technology to aid and grow society are limitless but the business model and profit margins that technology companies chase can cause more harm than good. Big technological companies put profit before people and their practises often go unquestioned. In their paper, Birhane does not advocate against using Western technology, automated systems and AI but rather asks us to examine them.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Traditional colonialism may be thought of as a physical invasion where brute force is enlisted to gain control of political, economic, and social authority and influence. Digital colonialism and algorithmic colonialism hope to achieve the same control but through software and AI without the explicit brute force. Therefore, while traditional colonization is different to algorithmic colonization in how it is implemented and executed their goals are inline, to assert dominance in social, cultural, and political spheres by gaining control of crucial systems central to running countries and generating wealth.\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n\r\n                        Digital and traditional colonization alike, use government, politics and wealth to sustain power using these systems in unison. Algorithmic colonization is present in the Global South through the dependency the Global South has on “Western software and infrastructure” (Birhane 2020). Western software and infrastructure are bias because they are created for and by the West, thus does not cater to the African countries and their needs. In their paper Birhane challenges “the relevance and appropriateness of AI software developed with values, norms, and interests of Western societies to that of users across the African continent”. Birhane makes the important point in his statement that relying on Western software and infrastructure is not ideal and can be damaging to the Global South because the cultures, value systems, social, political and economic systems are vastly different. With completely different priorities Birhane argues that Western software can often be more hindering than helpful. Birhane gives the example of medical software that is geared towards Western countries being implemented in Africa. The software will therefore not account for the different treatments and different medical conditions of the African country.  This illustrates that Western solutions can be more damaging to African countries than helpful because they do not take context into account.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n\r\n                        Dependency exclusively on the West, additionally leaves no space for local software and technology to be implemented giving the West an unchallenged space to control the global South through the technology sector. There are huge technological hubs all over Africa but none of them flourish at the level at the same level that Western companies and technologies do because most African companies and governments import technology and software instead of turning to local solutions.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Furthermore, Birhane discusses the danger of not questioning AI and technology and the dehumanizing nature of looking to AI to “fix” systematic and historical social issues. Birhane argues that societal issues cannot be quantified into a box that can be easily fixed using technology. Especially considering that technology is not neutral. Automated systems and AI solutions are often thought of as “neutral” and “objective” because technology is man-made it cannot have feelings or bias. However, because it is man-made technology carries the bias and ideals of its makers. Therefore, it can never be objective.  For instance, Western technology inherent Western thinking. When Western social, political and cultural ideologies are present it can be immensely dangerous. For example, GPT-3: OpenAI’s Million Dollar Language Model is inherently racist and sexist. It is a powerful machine learning tool that can mimic human like text producing poetry and even html code, for example it can take a prompt as input and output a completed sentence or sentences from the prompt. While it is powerful, it is also incredibly biased and prejudice. While language models can help create solutions to analysing data and optimizing systems etc, it can also be severely misused. For example, when typing in a sentence about Muslims as an input, the output received from GPT-3 revolves around violence, murder, and terrorism exclusively. This demonstrates the power and the terror of AI that uses Western Algorithms only. The creators of GPT-3 are aware of the racial and sexist nature of the AI and are researching on how to solve the issues, OpenAi still commercialized the software.\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Here are the examples of GPT3 and some of the racist and sexist outputs it generates.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <div className='imgs'>\r\n                    <img src={image5} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Abubakr Abid\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\"/>\r\n                    <img src={image4} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Abubakr Abidt\" className=\"screenshot\"width=\"400\" height=\"200\" />\r\n                    <img src={image1} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Kate Devlin\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\"/>\r\n                  \r\n                    <img src={image3} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Kate Devlin\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"/>\r\n                    <img src={image2} alt=\"OpenApi Tweet by Jerome Pesenti\" className=\"screenshot\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\"/>\r\n                    \r\n                    </div>\r\n                   \r\n                    <p>\r\n\r\n                        Ethics are often undermined when it comes to algorithms because they are thought of as neutral. The European Digital Rights organisation argues that “Policymakers must be aware of the political, social and economic consequences of ‘solutions’ that concentrate power in the hands of technology companies”. Birhane (2020) discusses the importance of ethics in algorithms and how it is important to have a board who reviews the ethics of algorithms especially having a local board because technology firms often go unchecked. Having a local board to ethically analyse technology will allow for context of that country and society to be considered instead of a one size fits all ethical board making decisions that might not benefit all countries and communities.  Ethical review boards can help eliminate and reduce the discrimination that marginalized people can face by automated systems such as facial recognition and biometric systems. Ethics boards also help ensure that the security and privacy of people is upheld. However, ethics board rarely are concerned with how technology and algorithms will affect those who are marginalized and discriminated against and are often centred around what is profitable and what “fixes” more societal issues. This is harmful because it is quantifying people into statistics and reducing complex societal issues into black and white problems that can be solved while subsequently ignoring the needs of marginalized people. The unethical ethical boards just deepen societal issues while generating profit for the already rich.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Africa is a continent where “community values triumph and nobody is left behind” (Birhane 2020). However, Western countries ideals are significantly different centred around thriving off rugged individualism. Based on the difference in ideals alone, Western technology is not suited to fulfil African ideals because it is built to fulfil Western capitalist ideals. Therefor it is urgent that African developers and innovators be the creators of the software and technological infrastructures implemented in African countries. Only then can Africa begin to break away from the coloniality sustained through technology.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <h3 className='page-header'>References</h3>\r\n\r\n                    <ul className='references'>\r\n\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Birhane, A.

Net art can come in a multitude of forms using a multitude of different software and hardware to create it. The internet also allows for interaction which allows for immersive and captivating pieces of art to surface. My preference in net art is net art used for social activism. The internet can speedily create awareness and spread information making it a great place to advocate for social causes. The interactivity that net-art affords also allows for people to participate in the art and experience a rich experience with the art. This can be demonstrated by the game, Phone Story, an important piece of net art that is educational and serves to spread an important message and awareness.\r\n                        \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Most people living in cities have a cell phone. We use our smart phones religiously and depend on them heavily. Yet not many people consider where their smart phone came from. How do cell phone companies keep up with such a high demand? What are the social, environmental, and economical effects of cell phone production? Where are they produced? Are they produced ethically and environmentally friendly? <i>Phone Story</i> answers all these questions and the answers are shocking and grim. \r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n    The satirical social activism game illustrates the <q> \"the dark side of your favourite smart phone. </q>. The game is free and available to play online in your browser, it can be downloaded as well and there is a mobile version as well. The game being free always thousands of people access to the game if they have an internet connection and flash for their browser, it allows awareness to be spread about the evils of globalisation and the evil and unethical practices of big corporations. The game is split into four self-contained mini games which enlighten players of the cold and dark truth behind smart phone production. The player is timed and if they do not complete the correct actions for each game, they will have to redo that mini game. The players must force workers and child labourers into coltan mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to mine the coltan to produce cell phones. The player patrols the workers ruthlessly while the workers get no breaks as they work long and hard hours in inhumane conditions. The next mini game is set in a cell phone factory called Foxconn factory which is a real factory. The player must prevent workers from committing suicide by catching them in a net as they attempt suicide by falling off the building. This mini game is especially difficult to stomach because this is the reality that overworked, exploited, and dehumanised factory workers face. These workers are not paid a liveable wage and have no lives outside working themselves to the bone for corporations that have outsourced their manual labour and are profiting off peoples abuse and exploitation. The third game takes place in a cell phone store where the player flings cell phones into consumers hands. This represents the high level of consumerism when it comes to smart phones. The last game is set in Ghana, where the smart phones are unethically being recycled for parts and again the workers are put in inhumane circumstances and forced to work by the player. The player hands the workers parts to sort in this game. This game really illustrates people’s complicity in the issue by having them enact the harmful actions. \r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n    The game's website has extensive research on each topic discussed in the game. The coltan mines, Foxconn Factory, consumerism, and unethical recycling of smart phones. The game also managed to earn above $6000 for an injured factory worker who attempted suicide at Foxconn. \r\n    </p>\r\n    <p> This piece of net art serves the important purpose of bringing awareness to the extremely harmful practices that big tech companies use to make profit and produce their products. People the environment and human rights are ignored in the name of profit and people are ignorant to it. Net art like this is important because it works to inform people of the colonial practises that are on-going due to neoliberal capitalism and globalisation. It effectively demonstrates how big mostly Western companies outsource their work to “third-world” countries so that they can get cheap labour, exploit their workers, destroy the natural resources of that country, and generate wealth for themselves without consequence. </p>\r\n    <p> Social activism in Net Art is prevalent spanning multiple different topics like equality, racism and decoloniality. Phone story can be categorised as a decolonial and social activist game and piece of Net art. Decoloniality revolves around dismantling coloniality and colonial systems. The game brings awareness to the evils of neoliberalist capitalism and globalisation and the breach of basic human rights by big corporations. Therefore, the game can act as a piece of decolonial work because it looks at smart phones, technology, capitalism, and labour without the Western lens of colonialism and capitalism. Through the lens of colonialism, the workers would be shown happy to be working their exploitation because working hard in the eyes of capitalism ideals means you will eventually gain wealth. This game however displays how coloniality is sustained through globalisation and neoliberal Capitalism. It exposes how Western companies still drain the resources from African countries, exploit people for their profit gain and continually get wealthier off their unethical and inhume practises. This game earns profit and starts a conversation to dismantle this system that has always been practised by the West. </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>While the mechanics of the game are simple, the mechanics effectively relay the message of the game. People can read about this information  but seeing it and participating it emphasizes the harmful cycle of production.

Having a responsive Nav bar and content is important because it allows for a larger audience of people to access and consume the websites content. If it is limited to laptop users only and cannot accommodate for mobile users, the website will be at a severe disadvantage as most people carry their phones around with them everywhere and will likely read the blogs on the website on their phone. Therefore, the biggest concern is to ensure the blogs are readable on as many screens as possible. My next greatest concern is having the navigation be responsive as without an intuitive and easy to use navigation system the user will get frustrated and leave the website. With creating a responsive website as my main goal, all the elements on the website are responsive and the website will smoothly operate on multiple devices. I am still currently working on making the images more responsive as they do not scale accurately enough from device to device. </p> \r\n                        <p>Additionally it is important to still adhere to conventions like having metatags and alternate titles for pictures to ensure screen readers can describe the image.

Technology is rapidly advancing but according to the Internet Justice Society only 39.3% of African people have access to ICT’s. Life without ICT access will further disadvantage those who are already disadvantaged. We live in an information society so it is only fair that all people should have the same access to the internet as a human right.  ICT is imperative to social, economic, and democratic spheres of life and people without access to it are at a disadvantage especially during COVID-19 when going to places in person is not a reliable option. For instance, libraries closed during lockdown, bookstores closed as well, therefor, information was limited to those who have internet access and enough data to download or view the research or information needed. Schooling was stopped and so people had to rely on internet access and technology to receive an education and those without the means were excluded and disadvantaged because they could not receive online education the same way their more privileged peers could. People without internet access are not the only people excluded. Websites and technology are designed for non-disabled people leading to people who are differently abled to find difficulty with websites and technologies because they were not considered in their design. For instance, blind children were not permitted to go into school thus had to receive their education online. Most websites do not make use of the correct semantic tags to ensure accessibility is possible for blind users. Often websites lack “alt” tags and use busy and cluttered pages creating a page difficult for a screen reader to appropriately relay information. </p>\r\n                    <p> With all these issues surrounding digital inclusion and digital equality it is our duty as South African innovators and creatives to try and help find solutions. Here are some ways we can get involved in shaping policy and trying to increase accessibility, inclusion and equality. </p>\r\n                    <p> A formidable program to apply to is AfriSIG (The African School on Internet Governance). Every year the Association for Progressive Communications runs AfriSIG which is a five-day residential course. AfriSIG has this event online now since COVID-19 struck. The overall goal of AfriSIG is to create African innovators who will change internet governance structures for the better and lead Africa’s technological development and internet access ethically with goals for equality and inclusivity. AfriSIG also prepares African technologists to participate in international policy making discussions and local government policy.  Participating in AfriSIG allows locals to engage with the policies and issues facing their own countries and facing most African countries, giving opportunities to people to find solutions and how to start laying the foundation for change.

FIFA hosts events and exhibitions hosted by tech industry professionals that anyone can register for and attend them online. The exhibitions showcase new technology and local inventions and discusses how it can be implemented in African states. FIFA has panels on digital rights and internet governance and what concerns revolve around them focusing on a purely African context. FIFA’s main goal is to change international internet governance to include Africa because it is rooted in a Eurocentric perspective and therefor only caters to fulfil Western needs. FIFA also works to discuss potential opportunities that would close the gap in digital inequality as well as how digital rights like privacy are being upheld and how they can better be protected.

The IGF aims to have people from all around the world join forces to discuss public policies around internet governance. Usually, delegates are sponsored to attend the Forum which is hosted internationally by one country. This year the government of Poland will host the IGF and will be online and in-person becoming a hybrid event. The theme for this year’s IGF is ‘’Internet United’ focusing on <q> Economic and social inclusion and human rights </q>. Delegates can speak and interact with people from different countries and professionals from the private and public sector working on internet infrastructure and exchange ideas and feedback on any proposals for policies. The IGF has their own mandate which acts as their agenda, it has principles like: \r\n                    <ul className='dots' >\r\n                    <li>Discussing public policy issues related to key elements of Internet governance to foster the sustainability, robustness, security, stability and development of the Internet.  </li>\r\n                    <li>Facilitating discourse between bodies dealing with different cross-cutting international public policies regarding the Internet and discuss issues that do not fall within the scope of any existing body. </li> \r\n                    <li>Interface with appropriate inter-governmental organizations and other institutions on matters under their purview. </li>\r\n                    <li>Advise all stakeholders in proposing ways and means to accelerate the availability and affordability of the Internet in the developing world. </li>\r\n                    <li>Contribute to capacity building for Internet governance in developing countries, drawing fully on local sources of knowledge and expertise. </li>\r\n                    \r\n                    <li>Publish its proceedings</li>\r\n                    \r\n                    \r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    If a local South African has an initiative they would like to implement regarding the internet landscape, the IGF will listen to the proposal and consider aiding and the initiative as part of their National and Regional IGF initiatives (NRIs).\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>NRI’s function independently from the IGF even though they may be endorsed by IGF. The creator of the initiative has free reign if they uphold the global principles of the IGF which equate to being ethical and inclusive. This gives local people a chance to drive the change they would like to see in their own internet landscape whether it be environmental change, accessibility, inclusion, or privacy. Read more about the IGF <a class=\"here\" href=\"https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/invitation-to-the-sixteenth-annual-meeting-of-the-internet-%E2%80%8Egovernance-forum-igf-%E2%80%8E\">here</a> </p>\r\n                    <p> There are a multitude more of organisations that South Africans can participate in to gain more experience and connections with internet governance and digital rights and inclusion to drive change in the South African technological space. We especially need these organisations to challenge government who still ignore the MIOS (Minimum Interoperability Standards) and create websites that are purely inaccessible by not using the prescribed open standards. For example, everyone needs access to the SARS website, but the SARS website uses flash which is propriety and does not meet the criteria to be considered an open standard. The website functioned mostly as a giant image making it incredibly difficult for screen-readers to use. SARS went against government policy and their inaccessible website forced them create their own browser purely to run the SARS website. This shows lack of consideration for South African citizens and displays outdated practises by using Flash which has been dead for a long period of time. Issues like these need to be taken up with government and challenged by local organisations and it starts by getting involved in the conversations like the ones hosted by the IGF, FIFA and AfriSIG. </p>\r\n                    \r\n\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theoryfour;\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Theoryfive() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Internet Access is a Fundamental Right.</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n<p>\r\nTechnology plays a dominant role in our lives, especially during the pandemic. We live, work, consume and socialize using technology. With stores closed and limits on travel everything was halted. People relied on technology and the internet to get them through this difficult experience. Groceries and other items swiftly moved to online platforms. School’s closed and moved to online venues. Social interaction turned from a night out to voice and video calling. Information on safety, vaccinations and hygiene were delivered to us through the internet as information rapidly changed every day. News outlets become pivotal to our health by reporting on the virus. The pandemic has revealed how much we rely on internet connection. Our livelihoods became dependant on it. This illustrates that we don’t rely on it for entertainment solely instead the internet has become fundamental to our right to work, education and freedom of speech yet the importance of internet connection is still undervalued (Kasapis 2020). The internet has become more prevalent and central to communication, information, and education, too many people are still denied access to the internet.  This blog discusses why the internet should be considered a fundamental right to all people globally. \r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n    Fundamental rights or human rights are a group of rights that have been declared as something all people should have. Different countries have different fundamental rights but follow similar suite such as the right to clean water, education, religion, food, medicine, and equality, etc. Fundamental rights are inherent to all people the moment they are born, and it is the duty of our governments to ensure our fundamental rights are fulfilled. Fundamental rights are necessary for people to survive and live healthy and happy lives they are categorized as needs and not wants or luxuries (Kasapis 2020). Internet access or right to broadband is an increasingly important movement especially during COVID-19. Without internet access people cannot work or receive an education, information, or social connection. In a South African context this infringes on people’s rights, the right to access to information, the right to education and the right to work to name a few. Those without access to the internet face further backlash from the digital divide as the internet has become so urgent in our everyday lives. We can clearly witness this with education in the pandemic.  The pandemic, students forced students out of call and online to receive their education. However, children from low-income families are at a serious disadvantage to those from higher income families (Tataki and Glynos 2020). Children from low-income families do not own the necessary software, hardware, or unlimited broadband to receive their education. Children who have laptops, pcs, and the freedom to use as much broadband as they like will not have to struggle like their peers who do not have the same means. The access to ICTs directly impacts the quality of education and disadvantages certain students over others (Tataki and Glynos 2020). This keeps certain children from the education they are promised as a human right. The UN recognized internet access as a human right in 2016 but governments are still doing very little to provide access to the internet to all its citizens. Only 59% of people globally have access to the internet (Daniolou 2020). This means that almost half of the world does not have access to the internet and in turn cannot receive the same education, information, and work opportunities the rest of the world with access has. Governments should be trying to provide free access to as many people as possible especially people who are cut-off from the internet and people who are marginalized as the digital divide is only going to further deepen and disadvantage those already disadvantaged (Daniolou 2020). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAccess to internet directly impacts the digital divide. The digital divide is the be described as the gap between groups of people and areas that have access information communication technology (ICT) including the internet and groups of peoples and areas that do not have access to modern information and communications technology and those that don't have access to modern ICT. The consequence of the digital divide is that people’s rights are not fulfilled. They do not have equal opportunity to education, the economy, politics, social and cultural spheres, their freedom of speech and expression is limited in comparison to those with access. For example, rural areas mostly fall under the category of regions that do not have access to internet and communication technology. This is known as the “rural penalty” (Daniolu 2020). Rural areas have strong communities that have their own traditions, culture, and knowledge. However, they do not have the means to offer their culture and knowledge to the rest of the world. These communities go unnoticed and unconnected (Daniolu 2020).  The information about the pandemic and COVID-19 and other important information will be difficult to reach such communities in a timely, central, and appropriate manner.  The local farmers and craftsman cannot access a wide network of clientele and grow their business.  The vernacular and art of the culture is kept isolated. No access to ICT, directly infringes on these communities’ rights and equal opportunities and further creates “social marginalisation” (Daniolu 2020).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nDaniolu (2020), makes an important argument that while ICTs are necessary and important, digital literacy is as equally important because it dictates how useful or harmful the internet and technology will be in someone’s life. If governments are meant to provide technology and internet, they must provide people an education on how to navigate the tools in a beneficial and critical way. Without a solid education in digital literacy people will be overwhelmed with fake news, false information and malicious software and internet trolls. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBridging the digital divide is imperative to create personal development, information and education access, stronger economies and cultures, global connection, and an overall better quality of life for all people. There are important social movements in place that work to bridge this gap like Linux4Africa, the UN’s ITU (International Telecommunication Union) and the twitter hashtag #Connectivity4All starts important conversations about the digital divide and how to close the gap. Movements like these are important as we need to find a way as young innovators to try and bridge the gap in our own communities since government intervention seems unlikely. We can make a difference by teaching digital literacy to people, researching, and proposing models to increase access and attending important forums that discuss internet access for all and closing the digital divide. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 className='page-header'>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul className='references'>\r\n\r\n    <li>\r\n    Tataki and Glynos - 2020 - Digital Divide Widens.pdf Download Tataki and Glynos - 2020 - Digital Divide Widens\r\n\r\n\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Kasapis - 2020 - Internet Access is a Fundamental Right.pdf  Download \r\n\r\n\r\n   </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n\r\n    Daniolou - 2020 - The Need for Global Internet Connectivity     </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theoryfive;\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Theorysix() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Technical Reflection 2.0</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Theorysix;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/whitepeople.ba01aa0d.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/pbt.5e5b1901.jpg\";","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nimport \"../Styles/blogs.css\";\r\nimport payblack1 from '../img/whitepeople.jpg';\r\nimport payblack2 from '../img/pbt.jpg';\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Theoryseven() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <div className=\"three\"><h1 className=\"page-header\">Internet Art Analysis</h1></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"intro\">\r\n                <div className=\"h-entry\" >\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                        <q><i>\r\n                            \r\n                        Pay Black Time is a play on the phrase “Payback Time,” and also a demand to pay back black people for the hundreds of years of free labour and continuing trauma in the US alone.

America is a society built on systematic racism and capitalism which constantly feed white supremacy and continuously disadvantage brown and black people. While brown and black people suffer at the hands of their society and its racist history, the American government does little to aid or end the unjust. Instead, big corporates and governments flourish off of white supremacy and capitalism but there are artists like Rafia Santana who are constantly fighting back and finding ways to bring about some change. This blog discusses how Rafia Santana’s use of net art and the internet for activism through her work #PAYBLACKTIME. \r\n   </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSantana started the project in 2016 after the idea was born from a facebook post she made, “Can a white friend Postmates me NyQuil and Soup? Is that how this works?” This sparked the flame that would result in #PlayblackTime. Santana devised the idea to use her platform on social media and the internet to request donations from white people for black and brown who need food. Santana created images with her idea and instructions on how to participate. Santana revealed, promoted, and circulated the project through images she made including memes. The images contained what the project was about, how to receive help from the project as well as how to donate and all the posts contained #PAYBLACKTIME. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<q>“All orders are paid for by the White Guilt Reparations Fund for white people who ask, “What can I do?” during a time when we have heavily publicized evidence of their race’s direct connection to the continuous suffering and disenfranchisement of Black / Brown people globally.

Santana was able to launch an entire activist project through visual images she created as an artist. She used memes and other internet vernacular to generate interest and connect with her followers. Using visual art as a medium for the message of the project ensured it was easy to share and the message was simple and clear garnering people’s attention and donations.  Her followers were easily able to share the project with each other and thus create a large network of potential donors. Santana was able to connect with people who needed help through the internet and was able to offer relief to wide array of black and brown people and not only people from her social circle or neighbourhood. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThrough her art not only was Santana able to help people but she was also able to spread an important message that black and brown people need justice. White people have historically built themselves on the backs of brown and black people and that has never stopped. Every system in America works against black and brown people from their police and healthcare system to their education system. Santana posts the powerful message that “White People Owe Us the World” as one of her posts.
